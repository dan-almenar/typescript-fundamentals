# TypeScript Fundamentals
This repo is just my entry point into TypeScript.

The starting tree has been set as follows:
- tsconfig.json: TypeScript config file, created automatically with the `tsc --init` command.
- src folder:
- - index.ts: original file that gets compiled into index.js file.
- dist folder:
- - index.html: basic html temlplate that serves as a placeholder.
- - index.js: compiled javascript file from index.ts

### Instructions:
Clone this repo, open the index.html with Live Server or any other local server, then jump into developer tools.

### TUTORIAL:
The index.ts file contains multiple comments that serve as a tutorial-like walkthrough.
#### Credit Note:
- [TypeScript Crash Course 2021](https://youtu.be/BCg4U1FzODs) video by Traversy Media on YouTube. I used the video as a reference for this repo, whilst refactoring and/or changing the code to better fit my needs and understanding of the language.
#### Further materials:
- [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- [TypeScript official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

### Requirements:
Being familiarized with JavaScript.
